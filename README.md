This repo contains my completed coursework for the 2020 C_S_50 course.

Objective of this repo is only to showcase my work.
It is not to be used to help with your own coursework.
If you have a question, feel free to ask me or the CS50 staff.
Unfortunately copying will not teach you anything.

Huge thanks to David J. Malan and team.
