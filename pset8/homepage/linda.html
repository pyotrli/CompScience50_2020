            <h4>Linda - The baddest bitch in Ecuador</h4>
            <img src="linda.jpg" alt="linda">
            <p class="subheader">I don't like dogs I don't know much. I've been bitten a couple of times as a kid and now I am always aware.</p>
            <p>As it turns out in Cuenca, Ecuador there are a good few of them in the town outskirts. Some are wild, some are owned, but they all just run around and enjoy chasing cars, bikes and people. None were that big, but when there are eight of them running up, barking, growling and doing what a pack does it's a bit discomforting. What if one stupid one decides to give you a little nuzzle for fun? Fun it certainly will not be. I kept on walking of course; you don't want to turn back on a pack of dogs, for they will certainly see that as weakness and are even more likely to bite.</p>
            <p>And then She sprinted past me and straight ahead towards the advancing pack. A little ginger god-knows-what-breed middle aged bitch known as Linda! Mother of two, lost shortly after birth. She was a stray that wandered into a women's convent where I was spending the night one day and managed to find her place somehow. To prove her worth, she did all she could. When someone would go for a walk through the streets of Beowulf's offspring, Linda was their tiny, feisty, ginger, Ultimate bodyguard... Ta Ta Daaaaa (dramatically please)</p>
            <p>At first I was a little concerned, she was alone, smaller than more than half of the dogs and was clearly a loner herself. That's not a good start to try and prove your worth, but prove me wrong she did!</p>
            <p>She dived into every crowd of dogs that she could see, as soon as she could see them. The first time it happened, I didn't think she'd get out of it. There were at least five dogs, all barking, squealing, in a ball of moving backs and tails and teeth. However, just a few seconds later they all retreated quickly uphill with semi-defensive barks, leaving a proud and upright Linda standing her ground with almost a smile on her face. The hair on her back standing, but not at all our breath of scathed in any way. She Enjoyed it. She was Good at fighting and knew it. She wanted it.</p>
            <p>From then on I looked forward to any dogs that would come our way to see Linda get her fix. It was fascinating</p>        </div>
