            <h4>Woman with child save me on a bus in Bolivia</h4>
            <img src="bolivia1.jpg" alt="bolivia">
            <p class="subheader">I rush to the bus stop. The bus will leave at 20:00 sharp. I get there with 10 mins to spare. All seems well. The bus arrives 5 minutes late. Not bad I think. We don't leave until 20:30 or so. I had time to eat properly then.</p>

            <p>Bolivian semi-camas are not as good as Argentinian, but not too bad. Certainly better than Nepal. I get to my seat, which seems occupied by a kid of 8 yrs old or so. His mum next to him asks me for my seat number. I indicate to her son. She gets up, picks him up and lets me through. Slowly but inevitably I realise that he will be on her lap for the next 12 hours. It'll be a tight squeeze and I hope desperately that he will be cool.</p>

            <p>As I am sitting there, waiting for us to depart I note the traditional Bolivian aprons, hats, wrinkly dark faces, long double braids tied together at the bottom and at times fully integrated into the apron somehow. Everyone seems a little weary, bracing themselves before a long journey. There are big blankets everywhere. I seem to be the only one without. It's well past sundown and well past sundown. How cold could it get? I am pretty warm just in my clothes. Well scarf, hat, sweater, jacket. It's still Bolivian winter, which I seriously underestimated.</p>

            <p>There is a TV! Van Damme is on it and I am sitting right under the main speaker. Jean-Claude has an interesting voice in Spanish. The sound is so bad I can really make it the words to even try and watch a movie in Spanish, so
            <p>I start listening to a brain podcast. They are talking about the cerebellum and motor skills learning. It gets a bit too technical and I drift off into an uncomfortable sleep. I wake up numerous times, the kid lies in my shoulder at times, but his mum, ever vigilant, hugs him back into position fairly quickly. I can barely feel my toes. It's cold. Very cold. No heating on the bus and it's below 0 outside for sure. The windows have a solid layer of ice on the inside. I twist and turn to try and find a comfortable position, which does not exist and thank the woman and child, despite my early prejudices. On one side I have a window covered in ice and on the other their warmth. You can't help but rub shoulders on these twisty mountains dirt roads.</p>

            <p>I wake up at 07:30, because we seem to have come to a stop. I open my eyes and am blinded by light. The sun has risen! It's only just above the horizon but it's warmth is tangible. I cant see outside for the ice, so I blow on the window. We are on a bridge. The landscape is out of this world. What a background for a sci-Fi film! The water under the bridge is half frozen, surface ice is floating down towards the horizon.</p>

            <p>I turn on my phone to have a look where we are. After 11 hours out of 12, we are 1/3 of the way there. Hmm... Patience, patience.</p>

            <p>Look out of the window now, the frost has melted off. Bolivia is beautiful.</p>
